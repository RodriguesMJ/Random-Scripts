\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Declaration of Authorship}

I, Matthew Rodrigues declare that the thesis entitled ``An Investigation into the Catalytic Mechanism of Vitamin B6 Biosynthesis using X-ray Crystallography and UV-Vis Spectroscopy'' and the work presented in it are my own and has been generated by me as the result of my own original research.

I confirm that:
\begin{itemize}
			\item This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a research degree at this University;
			\item Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated; 
			\item Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed; 
			\item Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work;
			\item I have acknowledged all main sources of help;
			\item Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself;
			\item None of this work has been published before submission.
\end{itemize}
